title: GTD in IT - Handling multiple projects and still being productive
---

About a year ago I stumbled upon what was for me some kind of holy grail.
I struggled for a long time with managing multiple parallel projects and lots and lots of tasks was forgotten about. Everything was an emergency and most of my time was spent putting out fires only to see a new one arise.

This took a great toll on me. I was exhausted and it affected both my professional and personal life so much that I was on sick leave for several months.
During the time I got the time to reflect. I needed to fix what was wrong and what was wrong was my energy! So I thought.

The problem was, I already had an ADHD diagnose that I was medicated for with Concerta. For you that's not familiar with ADHD pharmaceuticals - People with ADHD have lower dopamine levels and stimulants increases the dopamine levels in the brain. Concerta is a drug in the stimulant family somewhere in between amphetamine and cocaine so I couldn't blame energy.

Still I thought that energy was the problem - I was tired, no motivation. And the search lead me on the path of nootropics, that did help some but not much.
This is when I started to get interested in learning more about ADHD, I listened to podcasts about it at least 10 hours a week, I learned awesome techniques that increased my wellbeing a lot but still, my kryptonite was multiple parallel projects and things were still falling to the cracks.

In comes the world of productivity; A mention in one of the podcasts of ADHD mentioned something about a productivity method (sorry, can't remember which one) and it got me googling.
I eventually landed on a talk about David Allen - The creator of GTD - It seemed to be so much more than a bunch of "productivity hacks".


##What is GTD?

GTD is a way to organize your todo-list(s), calendar, projects, notes, ideas and dreams in a way that gives you a great perspective over what you have to do and when.
And the way you can handle multiple projects with it is according to me an awesome fit for IT.
