## Hello

Was about to create a blog at a seperate domain but i remembered: This is a lot simpler.



```powershell
# Never ever run this btw
$Computers | Get-ADComputer -Filter *
$Odds = @($true,$false)
ForEach($Computer in $Computers) {
    $Action = $Odds | get-random
    if($Action){
        $Computer | Remove-ADObject -confirm $false
    }
}

```
